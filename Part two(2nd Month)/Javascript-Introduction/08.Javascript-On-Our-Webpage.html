  <h1>JavaScript in HTML</h1>








  <!-- JavaScript, just as HTML and CSS, is a file.
      (for example script.js can be an external file ) 
      We put <script> tags on the bottom of the body 
      because browser should read first HTML and CSS files, which is faster 
      before reading Javascript. Depends of the weight, 
      Javascript can delay the website rendering.
  -->
  <script type="text/javascript"> 
  // If I use external link for javascript, don't type any javascript inside the script tags
    // alert('Hello!'); instead annoying pop ups, we will use console.log()

  // This is how we get that console to print stuff out:
    console.log('We are expecting a "Lorenzo" hurricane!');
  </script>
