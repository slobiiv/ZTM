* We have multiple Web Browser - and through HTML, CSS, JS we have beautiful websites.
* We need to figure out that whenever we send our files to the web browser, it all looks the same.
  And that is one of the biggest problems

  of different screens, and that is a very important concept something that, when you get to become a web-developer you'll encounter this problem where you have to test on each device, each browser to make sure everything works.
