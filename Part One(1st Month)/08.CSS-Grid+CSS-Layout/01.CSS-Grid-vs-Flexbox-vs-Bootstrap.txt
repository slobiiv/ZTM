There are three really good ways to do Layout this year:
  - One is something that we've discussed and that is FLEXBOX.
  - Another one was Bootstrap 4 (Bootstrap came before we had flexbox and Css grid)
  - and we are going to learn now about CSS Grid 

  ***  CSS grid and FlexBox work really well together.
       You don't only have to use just flexbox or justCSS grid. Use them both together and

  When it comes to Layout, good way to think about flexbox vs CSS grid is :
    - Flexbox is One Dimensional
    - CSS Grid is Two Dimensional

    *** It Is more important for us to learn FLEXBOX and CSS GRID because now if we know these two we can create
        any sort of LAYOUT!
