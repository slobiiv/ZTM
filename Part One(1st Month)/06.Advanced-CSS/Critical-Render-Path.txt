* When we talk about the critical render path we like to mention that CSS is a render blocking file so you won't be able to render a Web page until you receive your CSS and sometimes, if you have font files, you'll also have to wait for the text to render on the page.
So keep that in mind when you build your websites.

* What are some things that we can consider when doing this, so that our websites load up faster?
One is maybe to have our own font files.
Another one might be, that you don't want to make your CSS too big if we had hundreds and hundreds of lines of code of CSS.

* One method that people have used and you'll see often is something, called 'minifying' your CSS. 
(https://cssminifier.com/).
And what Minify does - it removes all the whitespace so everything is on one line, just really tiny together.

*******That is the critical render path, a path that a website takes to display something to the user.
