  Whenever you have a request from an employer to build a website or a web app, one of the first things that they will ask for is to make sure that your website is RESPONSIVE. So what is RESPONSIVE UI?
    In Browsers(Firefox Developer) developer tools, there is a phone icon called 'Responsive Design Mode'.
    We can set a different device to check if the given website is responsive.
    * So responsive means that your web site, no matter what, whether it's on the big screen or something like an iPhone,iPad.
      It is responsive. That means there's no cut-offs. Everything looks good no matter what size the screen is.

      ***** So keep this in mind: RESPONSIVE UI should be a priority when building websites.
