Before You Give Up

Here is the thing: Being a developer is hard. 
As a matter of fact, any profession that pays well and is in demand is that way because not everybody can do it. 
The people who succeed and get through the hard parts at the beginning, will be the ones who are rewarded. 
For this exercise, really try to push your boundaries and create a startup landing page on your own. 
Although you may think that you are a long way to go until you can build something on your own, 
in real life this is always the case: You will never have 100% knowledge of how to do something from the beginning. 
You start step by step, asking question on Discord, searching through google, trial and error while coding, 
until you get to the finish line. This is how real life of a developer works: 
You don't have an answer or someone you can follow along. 
People pay you money to solve hard problems that don't have a clear solution. 
So my challenge to you is this:
Based on your current skill, build something and challenge yourself.
 You may be surprised at what you are capable of doing with just the few things you have learned up until now. 
 It's easy to follow along a video and watch somebody code. 
 It's a lot harder to come to something on your own.

In the next lecture you will see my solution files, however there are many solutions possible here. 
No code is ever the same and everyone builds things differently. 
Just remember: 
Successful developers are the ones who struggle to improve their skills, and practice. 

Have fun :)
