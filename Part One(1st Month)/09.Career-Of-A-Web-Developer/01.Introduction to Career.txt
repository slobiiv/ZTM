    ** KEEP IN MIND that when you start off something like learning devolvement skills the first two months will feel
       like you are climbing an insurmountable mountain. Every video or course or tutorial or book that you read is going to make you feel like you're the only person in the world that doesn't know this stuff. 
       But I'm here to tell you to stay strong.
    ** What you'll learn is that being a good developer isn't necessarily memorizing a whole bunch of documentation 
       or code. It's about learning how to solve problems using all the tools that are available to you.
       And I'm going to leave you with that.
       Being a developer isn't easy.
       You really do need to know your stuff.
