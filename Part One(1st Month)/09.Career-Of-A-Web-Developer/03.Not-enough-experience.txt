What do I do if I don't have enough experience what if I'm underqualified for a job?
  - you should have this mentality in mind when applying to jobs and apply to jobs that you feel you are0
    under qualified for if a job is asking you to do something that you already feel confident then you
    should ask yourself What am I going to learn in this job.
  - job postings are put in order to weed out the weak candidates.

How can you have good experience if you're just getting started?
  - Github (Make commits and good history of things you have done!)
    Contribute to opensource projects
  - Website (Own a website)
  - 1~2 Big Project(Most difficult or Hardest)
  - Blog (Medium, Hackernoon)
    (Do you have experience?)

All you need to do is start something on your own and build something like a project or a portfolio or a blog post.

Experience doesn't mean on the job experience. Write about your portfolio projects.
Maybe talk about your website and how you built it. Talk about your get high profile maybe a hackathon you participate in and or open source projects you've worked on.
