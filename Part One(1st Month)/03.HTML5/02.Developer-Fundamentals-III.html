<!-- As Developers, we must get very very good for problem solving -->
<!-- 
     GOOGLING! 
     for example google what is <!DOCTYPE html> 
     W3Schools (recommended for beginners) 
-->
<!-- 
     You really want to understand how things work and what they mean.
     The developers that get really really good salaries, really good jobs, and are considered 'senior developers'
     are the ones that fully understand all the meaning behind the things that they do. 
-->
<!-- 
   * But any time you have any questions or you don't understand something fully, I do encourage you to Google and get    the answers because there's a ton of free resources out there for you to get fully, fully comfortable with the       topic.
     Or use  Discord to reach the professor or other students ***
 -->
<!-- 
     If you have a question or you don't understand something, do these things in order:
     1. Try Rubber Ducking: https://rubberduckdebugging.com/ (all great programmers I know do this)
     2. Use google and websites like stackoverflow (there is a video coming up on this) to find your answer. Most likely somebody has had your issue before.
     3. Reach out to our community on Discord (Invite link in lecture 3) where we have lots of smart developers who are there to help you. Learn to communicate and ask questions with fellow developers. 

     Still don't have the answer? Go back through step 1~3 and see if you missed something.

     4. If all else fails, look to see if others have posted similar questions in the QA. But keep in mind: Asking questions on Discord online community will allow your question to be seen by more people, and you can receive a faster reply than on Udemy. It also is better for back and forth dialog to debug code when something isn't working.
