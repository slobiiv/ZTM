* Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter!

What Selectors can have:
  .class
  #id (only ones)
  * (all elements)
  element
  element, element (selecting both h2, p)
  element1 element2 ( select all elements2 in element1)
  element1 > element2 (select all element2 that have parent element1 )
  element1 + element2 (select any element2 that is exactly after an element1)
  :hover { change behavior of element on hover, or mouse-over}
  :first-child (selects an first child of an element)
  :last-child (selects an  last child of an element)
  :important (Not recommended)

  What selectors win out in the cascade depends on : 
    - Specificity (Calculator : https://specificity.keegan.st/)
    - Importance
    - Source Order (In case we have more style-sheets imported, the style that happens after gets added.)

    * the more specific something is, the more likely it will win out and make sure that that is the style.
